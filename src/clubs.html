Events range from lunches with the Department Head and professors to learn more about their work to guest presentations with professionals working in sustainability to our infamous bzzr gardens and trivia nights. We also publish the undergraduate journal Trail Six, run the Geogarden, and celebrate the end of the year with a bang (the Geogala). With the advent of online learning, the GSA has adapted our events to a virtual platform to provide students with an opportunity to socialize safely.
