However, we want to dedicate a week to you, heroes on the planet of Science, to celebrate your hard work and give you a full week of exclusive superhero activities. SUS presents to you...Super Sci Week 2021!</p>
                    <p class='about-content-text'>From Monday, January 18th to Friday January 22nd, unwind with events like Yoga and Bullet Journaling or learn a new skill like our Painting and Cooking Events. Jump into action by crushing games during our Virtual Escape Room and Trivia Night or simply meet other heroes at our Clubs Day and Sustainability events. Finally, finish off the week by flexing your superpower at the “UBC Galactical Idol” Talent Show.</p>
                    <p class='about-content-text'>Throughout the week, win prizes at individual events, be entered in draws, and collect Infinity Stones at each event- the more the stones, the higher the chance of winning Apple AirPod Pros for the Super Sci Week 2021 grand prize.</p>
                    <p class='about-content-text'>What are you waiting for? Crime isn’t gonna stop itself and the sign-up forms aren’t gonna fill up by themselves!</p>
